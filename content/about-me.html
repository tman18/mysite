            <p>After I graduate from Kickstart Coding Bootcamp, I am pretty open to almost any job in the computer programming world. I would love for it to involve some QA, which I am very good at. I also always have a desire to learn more and expand my knowledge base, so I would love to have a job where I am still learning a great deal as well.</p>
