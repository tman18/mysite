        <h3>My story</h3>
            <p>I was born in Alameda in 1993 and have lived here all my life. I went to public school K-3 and private school 4-12. I graduated college from California State University, East Bay with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Statistics. After briefly working at a coffee shop, I have worked at Jews for Jesus in various positions now for almost 3 years.</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>I have a variety of skills in numerous areas. With my background in Psychology, I have a psychological mindset when it comes to life, which I believe has been able to make me a great people person as I can put myself in other people's shoes often. I love helping people, which helped me thrive in my previous role as Admin Assistant at Jews for Jesus.

        <h3>Future Job Interests</h3>
            <p>After I graduate from Kickstart Coding Bootcamp, I am pretty open to almost any job in the computer programming world. I would love for it to involve some QA, which I am very good at. I also always have a desire to learn more and expand my knowledge base, so I would love to have a job where I am still learning a great deal as well.</p>
